# Greenspace accessibility & health
## Project Overview

Does greenspace access correlate with reported mental health statistics across different neighborhoods or areas of a city?

Utilizing open-source data sets, we aim to analyze what “access” to greenspace might mean for city residents, including distance, greenspace type, and public access designations. Then, we will utilize mental health statistics to see if and how these correlate to access types. We hope to visualize these correlations.

## Data Sources
OpenStreetMap
CDC PLACES
NHIS

## Project Plan
### Challenges
-Data from NHIS is not currently easily accessible. We might need to find a different data source for mental health data.
-Heather is new to GitHub, version control systems, and writing code in collaboration with others.

### Collaboration: 
-Direct messages via Slack 
-GitHub pull requests
  +familiarize with workflow
  +review each other's code to better collaborate and create a cohesive product
