# Greenspace accessibility & health
## Project Overview

Does greenspace access correlate with reported mental health statistics across different neighborhoods or areas of a city?

Utilizing open-source data sets, we aim to analyze what “access” to greenspace might mean for city residents, including distance, greenspace type, and public access designations. Then, we will utilize mental health statistics to see if and how these correlate to access types. We hope to visualize these correlations.
